1. How to run?
$ python Perceptron.py

The program runs Perceptron algorithm, chaing the hyperparameter maxIterations from 1 to 10, and shows the learning curve as a result. For the default settings, it uses featureSet=1. If you want to change this, please uncomment the last few lines of code as follows:
	#drawLearningCurve(1, 11, 1, True)
	drawLearningCurve(1, 11, 2, True)
	#drawLearningCurve(1, 11, 3, True)
